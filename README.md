# Extension ðŸ’š CSM 

## a extension is created by me for chrome
- On your computer, open Chrome. At the top right, click More tools. then choose Extensions.
- Make your changes: Turn on/off: Turn the extension on or off.

- In this project i have created a web extension with the help of simple popup.html and manifest.json and used fetch api to fetch data for my extension
and also styled the extension with the help of css : so yes! this extension is completed and it's ready to be deployed;

- It's completed fully i have added screenshots here as well 
- for publishing this extension publically we need to create a developer account and pay 5$ fee to chrome web for publically publishing this so as of now i have not publically published this but for sure after i got placed i will be able to publish this..........so considering this please check my screenshots or in case if you not understand anything feel free to ask me : i will explain everything about this extension how to create it from scratch;
Thank you!
